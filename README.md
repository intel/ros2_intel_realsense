# ROS2 Wrapper for Intel&reg; RealSense&trade; Devices
These are packages for using Intel RealSense cameras (D400 series) with ROS2.

## Installation Instructions

The following instructions were verified with ROS2 Dashing on **Ubutnu 18.04**.

### Dependencies
#### Install ROS2 packages [ros-dashing-desktop](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/Linux-Install-Debians)

#### Install ROS2 dependences
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ros-dashing-cv-bridge ros-dashing-librealsense2 ros-dashing-message-filters ros-dashing-image-transport
  ```
  Or you may install from sources:
  * [cv_bridge](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/tree/ros2/cv_bridge)
  * [Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git) Currently, we support librealsense master branch.
  * [ros2_message_filters](https://github.com/ros2/message_filters)
  * [ros2 image_transport](https://github.com/ros-perception/image_common/tree/ros2)
  
#### Install Other non-ROS debian packages
  ```
  sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev pkg-config libgtk-3-dev
  sudo apt-get install -y libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
  ```
  * libssl-dev
  * libusb-1.0-0-dev
  * pkg-config
  * libgtk-3-dev
  * libglfw3-dev
  * libgl1-mesa-dev
  * libglu1-mesa-dev

### Install ros2_intel_realsense binary packages
  ```
  sudo apt-get install ros-dashing-realsense-camera-msgs ros-dashing-realsense-ros2-camera
  ```
  The ros2_intel_realsense packages installation have been completed. You could jump to [Usage Instructions](https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_realsense#usage-instructions) for executing, you could also install ros2_intel_realsense from source for more features. 

### Install ros2_intel_realsense from source
```bash
#get code
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_realsense.git

#build
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash
colcon build --base-paths src/ros2_intel_realsense
```

## Usage Instructions

### Start the camera node
To start the camera node in ROS2, plug in the camera, then type the following command:

```bash
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
# To launch with "ros2 run"
ros2 run realsense_ros2_camera realsense_ros2_camera
# OR, to invoke the executable directly
realsense_ros2_camera
```

This will stream all camera sensors and publish on the appropriate ROS2 topics. PointCloud2 is enabled by default, till we provide ROS2 python launch options.

### Published Topics
Rectified depth image: [/camera/depth/image_rect_raw](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.msg)

Color image: [/camera/color/image_raw](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.msg)

Rectified infra1 image: [/camera/infra1/image_rect_raw](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.msg)

Rectified infra2 image: [/camera/infra2/image_rect_raw](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.msg)

Depth registered point cloud: [/camera/aligned_depth_to_color/color/points](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2.msg)

### Visualize Depth Aligned (i.e. Depth Registered) Point Cloud

To start the camera node in ROS2 and view the depth aligned pointcloud in rviz:
```bash
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
# console #1 launch rviz2
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d realsense_ros2_camera/rviz/ros2.rviz
# console #2 launch realsense_ros2_camera
ros2 run realsense_ros2_camera realsense_ros2_camera
```

This will launch [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) and display the five streams: color, depth, infra1, infra2, pointcloud.

### Run tests
```Shell
colcon test --base-paths src/ros2_intel_realsense
```

## Known Issues
* This ROS2 node does not currently provide any dynamic reconfigure support for camera properties/presets.
* We support Ubuntu Linux Bionic Beaver 18.04 on 64-bit, but not support Mac OS X 10.12 (Sierra) and Windows 10 yet.

## Todo
A few features to be ported from the latest ROS [realsense](https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense.git)
* Preset/Controls
